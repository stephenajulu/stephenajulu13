      I'm a freelance remote front end web developer, graphic designer, I.T
      Consultant, Branding Expert and Content Creator based in Nairobi, Kenya. I
      love building and creating things e.g. brands, companies, products, tools,
      content and more, Since growing up I have always had this innate curiosity
      of finding out what things are made of and how I can tear them down only
      to build them up again. Some of my first jobs in Web development was
      reverse engineering website themes based on a client's want, something i
      still do today only rarely.


      I am currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Information Technology
      and have completed a Diploma in Information Technology, a Certificate in
      Business Information Technology, an Ethical Hacking Certification(CEH
      local), Adobe Photoshop and Corel Draw, a System Troubleshooting
      Certification, French Level 1 Language and finally did the
      basics/fundamentals of Cloud Computing, Cybersecurity and Web Development.


      I am a self taught "technologist", hence 60% of my skills come from Online
      Courses.


      To top that off I am a tech enthusiast always interested in trends such as
      Progressive Web Apps, The Comeback of Static Sites(e.g. Hugo), Machine
      Learning/AI, Quantum Computing, Big Data, VR/AR/MR, Blockchain, 3D
      printing and Robotics.
